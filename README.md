# SuperSmtp

Support Specific Source IP in Net::SMTP

## About

 This is kind of a dumb monkey-patch of Net::SMTP, but it's an easy way to
 support an extra option in Net::SMTP.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'super_smtp'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install super_smtp

## TODO

  I dunno... Maybe submit a pull request to Ruby to support this?

4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
